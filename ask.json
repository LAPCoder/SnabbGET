	 * A: "stack+" is a stack of arguments, that will be passed to the function.
	 *    The agguments will be concatenated, that's why they must be in a list.
	 *    Eg.: "stack+":[0, []]			-> arguments: (0, [{"cp"}])
	 *         "stack+":[7, ["toto1.txt"]]	-> arguments: (7, [{"cp"}, "toto1.txt"])
	 *         "stack+":[null, [null, "hi"]]-> arguments: (7, [{"cp"}, "toto1.txt", "<user's response>, "hi"])
