## What is SnabbGET?

SnabbGET is a guified terminal to be intuitive for beginners and easy to use for all devs. 

The idea of creating a terminal like that came out because we tought that it's pretty easy to be lost using a terminal, as a beginner.
And we are mainly lost because we use commands, parameters...
With our terminal, you won't be able to be lost! We will do our best to do the most beginner-friendly & easy to use terminal.

SnabbGET is cross-platform, a single language (SnabbScript) for *all* OS.

## Compile

Use the termial version (CLI):

```bash
make DEBUG=off
./output
```

Debug:

```bash
make
make run
```

To use the GUI version (in dev), you must have a Java sdk installed:

```bash
make runGui
```
