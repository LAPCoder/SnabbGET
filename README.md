## What is SnabbGET?

SnabbGET is a 'guified' terminal built with love for all beginners learning how to use a terminal. _It's not meant for professional uses._

The idea of creating this kind of terminal came out because we tought that it's pretty easy to be confused using a terminal, as a beginner.
This terminal makes everything easier with an user interface! We will do our best to do the most beginner-friendly & easy to use terminal.

We'll focus on OS such as Windows and Linux. No MacOS for the moment, sorry :(

## Compiling

Compiling the terminal edition (CLI) :

### Tools required

-> Version of C++ used : C++17

-> Any Linux architecture but a 64 bits arch. is required for Windows (MacOS not available)

### Makefile

```sh
make DEBUG=off
./output #.exe
```

**Debug**:

```sh
make
make run
```

_More informaitons about the GUI version will be given soon_
